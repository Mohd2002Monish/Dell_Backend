## Project Description: Backend for Web Application with User Authentication and Admin Privileges

The backend project is a feature-rich and secure web application that powers the core functionalities of a dynamic platform. The project focuses on providing robust user authentication, efficient product management, and exclusive administrative privileges to maintain control and data integrity.

Key Features:

1. **User Authentication**:
   - User Registration: New users can easily create accounts by providing essential information such as name, email, and a secure password. Passwords are securely hashed and stored to protect user data.
   - User Login: Registered users can log in using their credentials. The backend verifies passwords through advanced encryption techniques to ensure secure access to the platform's features.
   - Account Lockout: As a security measure, if a user enters an incorrect password multiple times, their account will be temporarily blocked for 24 hours, enhancing protection against unauthorized access attempts.

2. **Product Management**:
   - Product Retrieval: Authenticated users can access product data from the backend. The platform provides a comprehensive API to retrieve product details, including names, descriptions, prices, and availability.
   - Admin Privileges: Only designated administrators have access to critical product management functions. Regular users are restricted from performing administrative tasks to maintain data integrity and security.

3. **Admin Privileges**:
   - Add New Product: Administrators can enrich the platform's offerings by adding new products to the system. They can provide comprehensive details, including images, descriptions, and names, ensuring an up-to-date product catalog.
   - Update Product Information: Admins can efficiently modify existing product details to reflect changes in name, descriptions, or other relevant attributes, ensuring accurate product representation.
   - Delete Product: Administrators have the authority to remove products from the platform, keeping the catalog clean and relevant for users.

4. **Part Management** (Admin-Only):
   - Add and Remove Parts: Administrators exclusively manage parts within the platform. They can add new parts to enhance the system's capabilities and remove outdated or obsolete parts to maintain optimal functionality.

**Security and Reliability:**
The backend project prioritizes security and reliability by implementing state-of-the-art encryption techniques for user data protection. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are utilized for secure user authentication and session management. Rigorous testing and comprehensive error handling strategies are implemented to ensure a robust and secure application.


Overall, this backend project empowers the web application with secure user authentication, efficient product management, and exclusive admin privileges. By adhering to best practices and industry standards, the backend solution serves as a solid foundation for a reliable and high-performing web application.
